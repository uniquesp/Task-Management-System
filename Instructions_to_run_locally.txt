Instructions to Run the Application Locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher).
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
     ```
     FLASK_APP=app.py
     FLASK_ENV=development
     JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
     ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure your database server is running and accessible.
   - Modify the database configuration in the application to point to your local database.

4. **Run Database Migrations** (if applicable):
   - Apply any pending database migrations to set up the necessary tables:
     ```
     flask db upgrade
     ```

5. **Run the Flask Application**:
   - Start the Flask application by running:
     ```
     flask run
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - The application should now be running locally. You can access it via `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

7. **Testing the Application**:
   - You can use tools like Postman or cURL to test the registration and login endpoints.
   - Register a new user by sending a POST request to `/register` with a JSON payload containing a username and password.
   - Log in using the `/login` endpoint to receive a JWT token, which can then be used for authenticated requests.

8. **Stopping the Application**:
   - To stop the application, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the application is running.
